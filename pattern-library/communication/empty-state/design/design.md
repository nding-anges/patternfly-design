# Empty State

## Description

![Empty State with Callouts](img/empty-state-new.png)

1. **Icon** (optional): If an object icon is associated with this view, it can be displayed here.
1. **Empty State Title:** Give it a name.
1. **Text** (optional): This text should be personal and helpful. It should minimize the userâ€™s effort to complete tasks.
1. **Primary Action Button:** The primary action is displayed as a prominent blue button. See the [Action Labels](http://www.patternfly.org/styles/terminology-and-wording/#action-labels) section for more information about terminology and wording specific to action labels.
1. **Secondary Action Buttons** (optional): Secondary actions are alternative options for the user. They are shown as more subtle gray buttons and located below the main action. There can be more than one secondary action. See more alternative design for multiple secondary action:


  - If there are not  extremely long action labels for all the secondary action, we recommend  using the secondary gray button style. In case of differing  action label length, user could set an appropriate button width  based on the most longest action label and keep equal width for all secondary buttons.

  - If there are too much secondary actions or some of action labels are extremely long,  we recommend using text link button style.
